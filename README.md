Welcome to Coinly

This is an application for searching for crypto currency prices. Rather than using a public API I opted to create my own API (for the practice ofcourse) with some static data. The amount of coins in the database as of now are limited to just a few and the prices should be considered bogus and inaccurate as compared to the real world prices. 

In this application the user has to create an account in order to use the feature of searching for a crypto coin price. Although you could login in to a dummy account to look through with the following credentials:
Username: testuser
passowrd: password

The user has the ability to favorite any given coin which will be reflected on the coin card as "favorited".

In order to spin up this application you can either view the live site here or clone this repository on your local pc.

If opting for the cloning route, you will have to run the npm install command within each directory in order to install the releveant npm packages and dependencies.

To run the backend/server you will run this command in your terminal within the backend directory -> node server.js 
To run the frontend you will run this command in your terminal within the frontend directory -> npm start

This will prompt open a new window in your default browser with the application ready for local use.
